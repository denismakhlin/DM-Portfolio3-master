            I was born on April 26th, 2000 to the parents of Sofa and Anatoliy 
            Makhlin. My first language I learned was Russian, which I am now fluent in.
            As a child, I was known for having a bright imagination .
            believing anything and everything was possible. In the beginning of 
            second grade, I began to play basketball on a club team. Finally 
            quitting that team in sixth grade, I joined an AAU basketball team 
            named, “Bay City.” Bay City is a traveling basketball team for people 
            who are skilled in the art of basketball. This team inspired me to 
            understand the hard work and training that has to be put in a sport.

            <h3>Interest</h3>
            
            <!--My Paragraph about my interests-->
            
            <p>
            The same year, I joined the Grammy- Award winning,
                San Francisco Boy’s Chorus. Here I not only learned how to sing 
                and read music, but I also experienced unforgettable moments like 
                singing with the San Francisco Symphony, and performing at schools
                and opera houses. Singing has been my passion since I was a child,
                so after I left the Boy’s Chorus, I began to do musical theatre 
                at my school making the lead role in the musical. Music is one of
                my passions, and I hope to keep it as one of my main hobbies.

            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            
            <!--My Paragraph about my future plans-->
            
            <p>
                This year, I moved from San Francisco to Pasadena. I am now currently 
            a freshman at Pasadena High School. Here I hope to start the future 
            for my career. At PHS, I joined a program named, “App Academy” which 
            teaches computer development and gaming development. Computer science
            is my main passion, and I hope to pursue a career in the field of it.
            I hope to become a CEO of a company not only because of the money, 
            but also because it has been my dream ever since I got introduced to
            the computer.
